            "Follow up: Is Kasabian from a country that is part of the Dominion?",
            "\nIntermediate answer: Kasabian is a rock band from Leicester, England. The term \"Dominion\" historically referred to certain countries within the British Empire that were granted autonomy but still acknowledged the British monarch as the head of state. These included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, among others.\n\nEngland, being part of the United Kingdom, is not referred to as a Dominion. The United Kingdom itself was the sovereign state that had dominions within its empire. Therefore, Kasabian is not from a country that is part of the Dominion in the historical context of the term.\n\nHowever, if you are referring to the Commonwealth realm in the present day, which is a successor to the concept of the Dominions, the United Kingdom is still the central country, and its constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) do not have the same status as the independent nations within the Commonwealth that recognize the British monarch as their head of state.",
            "Follow up: What is the name of the British rock band known for the early 90's album \"Novelty\"?",
            "\nIntermediate answer: The British rock band known for the early '90s album \"Novelty\" is Jawbox. Jawbox was an American post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., and their album \"Novelty\" was released in 1992. It's important to note that while Jawbox is often associated with the post-hardcore and alternative rock scenes in the United States, they are not British. There might be some confusion or a mix-up with another band if you are specifically looking for a British rock band.",
