Although Robbins is actually American, not British, he played the character Phil Blumburtt, a lab assistant who befriends Howard.

            "\nIntermediate answer: As of my last update in April 2023, Tim Robbins, known for his work in film and television, has not starred in a Broadway production of a Stephen Sondheim musical. Tim Robbins is an acclaimed actor and director, but he is primarily recognized for his work in movies such as \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Mystic River,\" and \"Bull Durham.\"\n\nStephen Sondheim was a legendary composer and lyricist known for his contributions to musical theater, with works including \"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Into the Woods,\" \"Company,\" and \"Sunday in the Park with George.\" While many actors have performed in Sondheim's musicals on Broadway, Tim Robbins does not appear to be among them.\n\nIt's always possible that Robbins could participate in a Sondheim production in the future or that he might have been involved in a lesser-known or off-Broadway capacity, but as of the last update, there is no record of him starring in a Broadway production of a Sondheim musical.",

He is often credited with pioneering the concept of the jazz album in the 1940s while working for Columbia Records.
