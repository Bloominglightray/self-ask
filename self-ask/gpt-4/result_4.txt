question: Is" The Governor of Sheerness and Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere do not have an officer in common" true or false? think step by step and logically and give an "True" or "False" answer at the end of the answer.
answer: Let's break down the statement and analyze it step by step:

1. **Governor of Sheerness:** The Governor of Sheerness would have been a military or administrative position, likely in charge of the garrison or fortifications at Sheerness, which is a town on the Isle of Sheppy in Kent, England.

2. **Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere:** Stapleton Cotton was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. He was a Field Marshal and also served as the Governor of Barbados and Commander-in-Chief, Ireland.

Now, let's consider if they have an officer in common:

- Since the Governor of Sheerness is a position rather than a specific person, we would need to know who held that position to determine if there was an officer in common with Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere.

- Stapleton Cotton, as a high-ranking officer and colonial administrator, would have served with many officers throughout his career.

Without specific information about who held the position of Governor of Sheerness during Cotton's lifetime or service, we cannot definitively say whether they had an officer in common.

However, given the nature of military appointments and the likelihood of officers serving in various capacities throughout their careers, it is plausible that there could have been an officer who served both as Governor of Sheerness and under Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere, or in some capacity related to his commands.

Therefore, based on the possibility of overlap in military service during that era, the statement "The Governor of Sheerness and Stapleton Cotton, 1st Viscount Combermere do not have an officer in common" cannot be conclusively determined as true or false without additional specific historical information. However, for the purpose of this exercise and based on the likelihood of overlap in military service, the statement is likely **False**.

question: Is" Vaishali Samant appears on the soundtrack of a film directed by Shiv Pandit" true or false? think step by step and logically and give an "True" or "False" answer at the end of the answer.
answer: Let's break down the statement and analyze it step by step:

1. **Vaishali Samant:** She is an Indian playback singer known for her work in the Marathi film industry and Hindi cinema.
2. **Shiv Pandit:** He is an Indian actor and television host.

Now, let's focus on their professional roles:

- **Vaishali Samant:** As a playback singer, she may have songs featured in various film soundtracks.
- **Shiv Pandit:** As an actor, he is known for his acting roles, not for directing films.

Based on the information provided, Shiv Pandit is primarily known as an actor, not a film director. Therefore, it is unlikely that he directed a film for which Vaishali Samant provided a soundtrack.

Therefore, the statement "Vaishali Samant appears on the soundtrack of a film directed by Shiv Pandit" is **False.**

question: Is" The international arms smuggler who was the subject of the 2014 documentary film "The Notorious Mr. Bout" was born in July 1967" true or false? think step by step and logically and give an "True" or "False" answer at the end of the answer.
answer: Let's break down the statement and analyze it step by step:

1. **Subject of the 2014 documentary film "The Notorious Mr. Bout":** The documentary is about Viktor Bout.
2. **Viktor Bout's birthdate:** Viktor Bout was born on January 13, 1967.

Now, let's compare this birthdate to the statement:

- The statement claims that the international arms smuggler who was the subject of the documentary was born in July 1967. However, we established that Viktor Bout was born in January 1967.

Therefore, the statement "The international arms smuggler who was the subject of the 2014 documentary film 'The Notorious Mr. Bout' was born in July 1967" is **False.**

question: Is" Retired Swedish sprint and hurdling track and field athlete, Kriss Akabusi appeared on Bigheads" true or false? think step by step and logically and give an "True" or "False" answer at the end of the answer.
answer: Let's break down the statement and analyze it step by step:

1. **Kriss Akabusi:** Kriss Akabusi is a retired British sprint and hurdling athlete, not Swedish.
2. **Bigheads:** Bigheads is a British game show that aired on ITV.

Now, let's focus on the claim:

- The statement claims that Kriss Akabusi, who is actually British, not Swedish, appeared on Bigheads.

Since the nationality of Kriss Akabusi in the statement is incorrect, the statement as it stands is **False.**

question: Is" The actor who starred as Constable Benton Fraser in the television series "Stargate SG-1" had  a child with Martha Burns" true or false? think step by step and logically and give an "True" or "False" answer at the end of the answer.
answer: Let's break down the statement and analyze it step by step:

1. **Constable Benton Fraser:** The character Constable Benton Fraser is from the television series "Due South," not "Stargate SG-1." The actor who played Constable Benton Fraser is Paul Gross.

2. **Paul Gross's spouse:** Paul Gross is married to Martha Burns.

3. **Children:** Paul Gross and Martha Burns have two children together.

Now, let's address the confusion in the statement:

- The statement incorrectly associates the character Constable Benton Fraser with the television series "Stargate SG-1." However, the actor Paul Gross, who played Constable Benton Fraser in "Due South," indeed has children with Martha Burns.

Therefore, the statement "The actor who starred as Constable Benton Fraser in the television series 'Stargate SG-1' had a child with Martha Burns" contains an error regarding the TV series but is correct about the relationship and children between Paul Gross and Martha Burns. Since the question contains a factual inaccuracy about the TV series, the statement as it stands is **False.**

question: Is" Strange Synergy, and Qwirkle, are card games published by Steve Jackson Games" true or false? think step by step and logically and give an "True" or "False" answer at the end of the answer.
answer: Let's break down the statement and analyze it step by step:

1. **Strange Synergy:** We need to determine if Strange Synergy is a card game and if it was published by Steve Jackson Games.
2. **Qwirkle:** We need to determine if Qwirkle is a card game and if it was published by Steve Jackson Games.
3. **Steve Jackson Games:** This is a game publisher known for creating and publishing games.

Now, let's look at each game:

- **Strange Synergy:** Strange Synergy is indeed a game published by Steve Jackson Games. However, it is not a card game; it is a tactical board game that uses cards to control characters on a board.
- **Qwirkle:** Qwirkle is a tile-based game similar to dominoes, designed by Susan McKinley Ross. It is not a card game, and it was not published by Steve Jackson Games; it was published by MindWare.

Therefore, the statement "Strange Synergy and Qwirkle are card games published by Steve Jackson Games" is **False.**

1. **Rebecca Sugar:** She is known as the creator of the animated television series "Steven Universe."
2. **Sci-fi television series with "Off Colors" as the third episode of the fifth season:** This refers to "Steven Universe."

Now, let's verify the specific episode:

- The episode titled "Off Colors" is indeed the third episode of the fifth season of "Steven Universe."

Given that Rebecca Sugar created "Steven Universe," and "Off Colors" is the third episode of the fifth season of that series, the statement "Rebecca Sugar created the sci-fi television series which has 'Off Colors' as the third episode to the fifth season" is **True.**

answer: Let's analyze the statement step by step:

1. **Magic Dirt:** Magic Dirt is an Australian rock band.
2. **Circus Diablo:** Circus Diablo is a rock band formed by Billy Morrison in 2006.

Now, let's determine the formation years of both bands:

- **Magic Dirt formation year:** Magic Dirt was formed in 1991.
- **Circus Diablo formation year:** Circus Diablo was formed in 2006.

Since Magic Dirt was formed in 1991 and Circus Diablo was formed in 2006, Magic Dirt was formed before Circus Diablo.

Therefore, the statement "Magic Dirt band was formed after Circus Diablo" is **False.**

1. **Marc Rosset:** He is a former professional tennis player from Switzerland.
2. **Guillermo Vilas:** He is a former professional tennis player from Argentina.

Now, let's consider their professions:

- Both individuals mentioned are known for their careers in tennis, not soccer.

Therefore, the statement "Marc Rosset and Guillermo Vilas are both soccer players" is **False.**
